Data Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IPUMS NHGIS is generating Privacy-Protected Summary Files (PPSF) from the US 
Census Bureau's Privacy-Protected Microdata File (PPMF). The PPMF was produced 
by the TopDown Algorithm, which uses differentially private mechanism to protect
respondent privacy. IPUMS NHGIS converts the PPMF, where every record is a 
person, into a summary file, where every record is a geographic unit. 
Converting the microdata to counts for geographic units facilitates use by 
scientists and researchers.

After producing the PPSF, IPUMS NHGIS merges the PPSF with data from 
Summary File 1 (SF1) of the 2010 Decennial Census. We call this linked file the 
Privacy-Protected 2010 Census Demonstration Data. Users may compare PPSF and SF1 counts to 
assess TopDown's impact on the quality and utility of the data. Counts from 
the PPSF have a "_dp" suffix on the column headers, and counts from SF1 have 
a "_sf" suffix on the column headers. This dataset is in a wide format and 
comes as a comma-separated value (CSV) file. 

Tabulations in this Privacy-Protected Demonstration Data file are derived from
the 20200527 vintage PPMF. Technical documentation for the PPMF, along with
the original microdata file, are availalble at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/planning-management/2020-census-data-products/2020-das-metrics.html
