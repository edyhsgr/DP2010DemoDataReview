Data Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This data file contains the variables that are found in segment 1 of the 
Census Bureau's 2010 Demonstration Data Product. The 2010 Demonstration Data 
Product uses a differentially private algorithm to inject noise into the 2010
decennial census data. This data file facilitates the comparison of the noise-
injected data vs. the original 2010 decennial data.

Technical documentation and raw data files for the 2010 Demonstration Product 
can be found at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/planning-management/2020-census-data-products/2010-demonstration-data-products.html

Segment 1 of the demonstration product contains person variables. In particular,
segment 1 contains variables from the following 2010 Summary File 1 tables:

P1
P2
P3
P4
P5
P6
P7
P12

This data file is in a long format. Each record is a combination of a 
geographic unit and a variable code. Each file has the same record 
layout:

gisjoin:     GIS Join Match Code
name_dp:     Area Name-Legal/Statistical Area Description (LSAD) Term-Part Indicator from the 2010 Demonstration product
var_code:    Variable code
dp:          Variable value from the 2010 Demonstration product (the noise-injected value)
name_sf:     Area Name-Legal/Statistical Area Description (LSAD) Term-Part Indicator from the 2010 Summary File 1
sf:          Variable value from the 2010 Summary File 1 product

IPUMS NHGIS staff created data files for 11 different geographic levels. File
names and their meanings are:

1. long_dp1_040.csv - State
2. long_dp1_050.csv - County
3. long_dp1_060.csv - County subdivision
4. long_dp1_160.csv - Place
5. long_dp1_230.csv - Alaska Native Regional Corporation 
6. long_dp1_250.csv - American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land
7. long_dp1_310.csv - Core-based statistical area (CBSA)
8. long_dp1_400.csv - Urban areas
9. long_dp1_500.csv - 111th Congressional district 
10. long_dp1_610.csv - State legislative district (upper chamber)
11. long_dp1_620.csv - State legislative district (lower chamber)

The remainder of this codebook describe the contents of each column and a 
description of each var_code.
