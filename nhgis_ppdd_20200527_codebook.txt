Data Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IPUMS NHGIS is generating Privacy-Protected Summary Files (PPSF) from the US 
Census Bureau's Privacy-Protected Microdata File (PPMF). The PPMF was produced 
by the TopDown Algorithm, which uses differentially private mechanism to protect
respondent privacy. IPUMS NHGIS converts the PPMF, where every record is a 
person, into a summary file, where every record is a geographic unit. 
Converting the microdata to counts for geographic units facilitates use by 
scientists and researchers.

After producing the PPSF, IPUMS NHGIS merges the PPSF with data from 
Summary File 1 (SF1) of the 2010 Decennial Census. We call this linked file the 
Privacy-Protected 2010 Census Demonstration Data. Users may compare PPSF and SF1 counts to 
assess TopDown's impact on the quality and utility of the data. Counts from 
the PPSF have a "_dp" suffix on the column headers, and counts from SF1 have 
a "_sf" suffix on the column headers. This dataset is in a wide format and 
comes as a comma-separated value (CSV) file. 

Tabulations in this Privacy-Protected Demonstration Data file are derived from
the 20200527 vintage PPMF. Technical documentation for the PPMF, along with
the original microdata file, are availalble at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/planning-management/2020-census-data-products/2020-das-metrics.html

This demonstration data file contains variables from the following tables:

P1 - Total Population
P3 - Race (7 categories)
P4 - Hispanic or Latino Origin
P5 - Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino by Race
P8 - Race (63 categories)
P9 - Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino by Race (63 categories)
P10 - Race (63 categories) for the Population 18 Years and Over
P11 - Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino by Race (63 categories) for the Population 18 Years and Over
P12 - Sex by Age
P42 - Group Quarters Population by Group Quarters Type

IPUMS NHGIS staff created data files for 15 different geographic levels. File

7. nhgis_ppdd_20200527_anrc.csv - Alaska Native Regional Corporation
8. nhgis_ppdd_20200527_aianhh.csv - American Indian/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land
9. nhgis_ppdd_20200527_cbsa.csv - Core-based statistical area (CBSA)
10. nhgis_ppdd_20200527_urb_area.csv - Urban areas
11. nhgis_ppdd_20200527_cd_110th-112th.csv - 111th Congressional district

13. nhgis_ppdd_20200527_stleg_lo.csv - State legislative district (lower chamber)
14. nhgis_ppdd_20200527_sduni.csv - School district (unified)
15. nhgis_ppdd_20200527_block_<State Postal Code>.csv - Block

Block data are separated into state-specific files.
